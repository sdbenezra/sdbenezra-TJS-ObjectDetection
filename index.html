        <h1>Object Detection Demo</h1>
        <p1>Model may take a few seconds to download when you first load this page.</p1><br/>
        <p1>Upload a picture using the button that appears below.</p1><br/>
        <p1>Objects will be identified, boxed, and labeled after analyzing.</p1><br/><br/>
        <p1>It may take a minute or two for the analysis to occur, and it's still experimental.</p1>
        <p1>If you don't see results in a minute, try uploading a different picture, with one or two items and an uncluttered background.</p1><br/>
        <p1>It also tends to run faster on a computer rather than mobile.</p1><br/>
        <p1><b>Any pictures you upload will stay on your machine, they are not sent over the internet.</b></p1>
