# Image Recognition with Transformers.js

This is a Vanilla JS demo project using the [Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/index) library that allows you to run AI models in the browser, no server needed!

The project is simple consisting of only HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I began with the starting code and tutorials found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/tutorials/vanilla-js).

## Running the code

Download the html, css, javascript files to your machine. 
Start a server. (Two options are [VS Code Live Server](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server/tree/428e01caf02bfa7ee75741df0f02fc9d2b5b0999) and [Live Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)) Open the html in your browser, download of the model will begin. When it is ready the 'Upload image' button will appear, and you can then upload an image.

Simply upload a picture to your browser using the upload image button. The model will analyze the image and display boxes around the objects it identifies along with their labels.
